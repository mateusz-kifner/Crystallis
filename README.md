Crystallis is a 3D dungeon crawler with not enough levels and too many features to be finished in the given timeframe.
Crystallis is a 3D dungeon crawler, where how you ended the last level changes how you will go through the next one. On every level there are 3 crystals that you might find but you can only take one of them to the end of the stage. Upon opening the portal to the next level the crystal breaks into a few pieces that might be used to open doors on the next one.

The game includes "very climatic and epic" fights, puzzles and platforming (for god knows why). Dying in this game doesn't make you go back to the checkpoint or restarts the game, upon death you get teleported to the start of the game with all of your items (excluding shards and crystals). As we only managed to add a single level the game is only a prototype, a proof of concept, a concept that isn't really showed here.
